@article{initialpopulationMetricApproach,
	abstract = {{Besides the difficulty of the application
	problem to be solved with Genetic Algorithms (GAs),
	an additional difficulty arises because the quality of the
	solution found, or the computational resources required
	to find it, depends on the selection of the Genetic
	Algorithm's characteristics. The purpose of this paper
	is to gain some insight into one of those characteristics:
	the difficult problem of finding a good initial population.
	We summarize previous approaches and metrics related
	to this problem and we suggest the center of mass as
	an alternative metric to measurement diversity at the
	population level. This theoretical approach of analysis
	and measure of the diversity of the initial random
	population is important and could be quite necessary
	for the design of GAs because of the relation of the
	initial population to other GA parameters and operators
	and because of its relation to the problem of premature
	convergence.}},

The new algorithm has the desirable property of processing the string symbol by symbol from left to right. It always has the suffix tree for the scanned part of the string ready. The method is developed as a linear-time version of a very simple algorithm for (quadratic size) suffixtries. Regardless of its quadratic worst case this latter algorithm can be a good practical method when the string is not too long. Another variation of this method is shown to give, in a natural way, the well-known algorithms for constructing suffix automata (DAWGs).",

	abstract = {{UniProt is an important collection of protein sequences and their annotations, which has doubled in size to 80 million sequences during the past year. This growth in sequences has prompted an extension of UniProt accession number space from 6 to 10 characters. An increasing fraction of new sequences are identical to a sequence that already exists in the database with the majority of sequences coming from genome sequencing projects. We have created a new proteome identifier that uniquely identifies a particular assembly of a species and strain or subspecies to help users track the provenance of sequences. We present a new website that has been designed using a user-experience design process. We have introduced an annotation score for all entries in UniProt to represent the relative amount of knowledge known about each protein. These scores will be helpful in identifying which proteins are the best characterized and most informative for comparative analysis. All UniProt data is provided freely and is available on the web at http://www.uniprot.org/.}},

@Inproceedings {MikolovLinguisticRegularities,
	abstract     = {<p>Continuous space language models have recently demonstrated outstanding
	results across a variety of tasks. In this paper, we examine the vector-space
	word representations that are implicitly learned by the input-layer weights. We
	find that these representations are surprisingly good at capturing syntactic and
	semantic regularities in language, and that each relationship is characterized by
	a relation-specific vector offset. This allows vector-oriented reasoning based on
	the offsets between words. For example, the male/female relationship is
	automatically learned, and with the induced vector representations, “King - Man +
	Woman” results in a vector very close to “Queen.” We demonstrate that the word
	vectors capture syntactic regularities by means of syntactic analogy questions
	(provided with this paper), and are able to correctly answer almost 40{\%} of the
	questions. We demonstrate that the word vectors capture semantic regularities by
	using the vector offset method to answer SemEval-2012 Task 2 questions.
	Remarkably, this method outperforms the best previous systems.</p>},

	abstract="We present a meta-learning method to support selection of candidate learning algorithms. It uses a k-Nearest Neighbor algorithm to identify the datasets that are most similar to the one at hand. The distance between datasets is assessed using a relatively small set of data characteristics, which was selected to represent properties that affect algorithm performance. The performance of the candidate algorithms on those datasets is used to generate a recommendation to the user in the form of a ranking. The performance is assessed using a multicriteria evaluation measure that takes not only accuracy, but also time into account. As it is not common in Machine Learning to work with rankings, we had to identify and adapt existing statistical techniques to devise an appropriate evaluation methodology. Using that methodology, we show that the meta-learning method presented leads to significantly better rankings than the baseline ranking method. The evaluation methodology is general and can be adapted to other ranking problems. Although here we have concentrated on ranking classification algorithms, the meta-learning framework presented can provide assistance in the selection of combinations of methods or more complex problem solving strategies.",

The machine conceptually implements the following idea: input vectors are non-linearly mapped to a very high-dimension feature space. In this feature space a linear decision surface is constructed. Special properties of the decision surface ensures high generalization ability of the learning machine. The idea behind the support-vector network was previously implemented for the restricted case where the training data can be separated without errors. We here extend this result to non-separable training data.",

	abstract = "Appropriate choice of a kernel is the most important ingredient of the kernel-based learning methods such as support vector machine (SVM). Automatic kernel selection is a key issue given the number of kernels available, and the current trial-and-error nature of selecting the best kernel for a given problem. This paper introduces a new method for automatic kernel selection, with empirical results based on classification. The empirical study has been conducted among five kernels with 112 different classification problems, using the popular kernel based statistical learning algorithm SVM. We evaluate the kernels’ performance in terms of accuracy measures. We then focus on answering the question: which kernel is best suited to which type of classification problem? Our meta-learning methodology involves measuring the problem characteristics using classical, distance and distribution-based statistical information. We then combine these measures with the empirical results to present a rule-based method to select the most appropriate kernel for a classification problem. The rules are generated by the decision tree algorithm C5.0 and are evaluated with 10 fold cross validation. All generated rules offer high accuracy ratings. "

Recently Eiter and Mannila have proposed a new measure which is computable in polynomial time. However, it is not a distance function in the mathematical sense because it does not satisfy the trian gle inequality. We introduce a new measure which is a metric while being computable in polynomial time. We also present a variant which computes a normalised metric and a variant which can associate different weights with the points in the set.",
